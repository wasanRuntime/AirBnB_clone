'AirBnB Command Interpreter'
Welcome to the AirBnB Command Interpreter project! This command interpreter is designed to manage your AirBnB objects and serves as the foundational step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This project is crucial as it forms the basis for subsequent tasks including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

'Project Description'
The project involves creating a command interpreter to handle AirBnB objects. It includes the following key aspects:

Implementing a parent class called BaseModel responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.
Developing specific classes for AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from BaseModel.
Building the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Writing comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the AirBnB Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-command-interpreter.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd airbnb-command-interpreter
Run the command interpreter:

bash
Copy code
python3 console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter various commands to manage AirBnB objects. Here are some available commands:

create <class_name>: Creates a new instance of the specified class.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
show <class_name> <id>: Displays the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
destroy <class_name> <id>: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678
all [class_name]: Displays all instances of a specific class or all classes if no class name is provided.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) all
(hbnb) all User
update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> "<attribute_value>": Updates an instance attribute based on the class name and id.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678 name "John Doe"
quit or EOF: Exits the command interpreter.

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) quit
Examples
Creating a User instance:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
Updating the name of a User instance:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678 name "Alice"
Showing details of a User instance:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
Displaying all instances of a specific class:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) all User
Deleting a User instance:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678
