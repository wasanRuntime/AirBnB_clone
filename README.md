'AirBnB Command Interpreter'
Welcome to the AirBnB Command Interpreter project! This command interpreter is designed to manage your AirBnB objects and serves as the foundational step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This project is crucial as it forms the basis for subsequent tasks including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

'Project Description'
The project involves creating a command interpreter to handle AirBnB objects. It includes the following key aspects:

Implementing a parent class called BaseModel responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.
Developing specific classes for AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from BaseModel.
